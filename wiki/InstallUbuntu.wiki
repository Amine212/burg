#summary Install BURG in ubuntu karmic/lucid

Here are the steps to install BURG using PPA package from launchpad.

1. Insert these lines to /etc/apt/sources.list

Ubuntu Karmic:
{{{
deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/bean123ch/burg/ubuntu karmic main
deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/bean123ch/burg/ubuntu karmic main
}}}

Ubuntu Lucid:
{{{
deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/bean123ch/burg/ubuntu lucid main
deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/bean123ch/burg/ubuntu lucid main
}}}

And install burg and related themes using these commands:
{{{
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install burg burg-themes
}}}

If you want to avoid the warning about unknown signature, use these commands to import it:
{{{
gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv 55708F1EE06803C5
gpg --export --armor 55708F1EE06803C5 | sudo apt-key add -
}}}

Then, install burg to MBR with the following command:
{{{
sudo burg-install "(hd0)"
}}}
Change hd0 if you want to install to other disk.

2. Edit configuration file /etc/default/burg

For the latest version, you don't need to modify /etc/default/burg at all. If you upgrade from previous version, it's recommended to change the setting of GRUB_THEME and GRUB_FOLD to:

{{{
GRUB_THEME=saved
GRUB_FOLD=saved
}}}

This allows to change theme and folding options dynamically.

Here are the hot-keys defined in the boot menu:

  * t - Open theme selection menu
  * f - Toggle between folding mode
  * n - Jump to the next item with the same class
  * w - Jump to the next Windows item
  * u - Jump to the next Ubuntu item
  * e - Edit the command of current boot item
  * c - Open a terminal window
  * 2 - Open two terminal windows
  * h - Display help dialog (only available in sora theme)
  * i - Display about dialog (only available in sora theme)
  * q - Return to old grub menu
  * F5/ctrl-x - Finish edit
  * F6 - Switch window in dual terminal mode
  * F7 - List the folded boot items
  * F8 - Toggle between graphic and text mode
  * F9 - shutdown
  * F10 - reboot
  * ESC - quit from the current popup menu or dialog.

Since 20100309 version, burg also supports grub theme. To try it, set GRUB_THEME to the name of the theme file, and run update-burg. Currently only one grub theme is available in burg-themes package:

{{{
GRUB_THEME=/boot/burg/themes/debian-theme/theme.txt
}}}

3. Live preview themes in host OS

You can install the optional package burg-emu:
{{{
sudo apt-get install burg-emu
}}}

To preview the current configuration, use this command:
{{{
sudo burg-emu
}}}

grub theme needs to access disk directly, to preview it, you need to add -D option:
{{{
sudo burg-emu -D
}}}

#summary Document on the configuration variable in /etc/default/burg

= GRUB_DEFAULT =
Value: menu item index (0 based) or saved<br>
Default: 0

This variable configures the default menu item. When its value is saved, it uses the one stored in burgenv as default. Please note that to achieve the save default effect, you need to set GRUB_DEFAULT to saved, and GRUB_SAVEDEFAULT to true.

= GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT =
Value: any string to indicate true, "" to indicate false.<br>
Default: "" (false)

If this variable is true, it would not display timeout in menu, but sleep silently. You can use ESC key to interrupt the sleep and display menu normally.

= GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET =
Value: "true" to indicate true, any other string to indicate false.<br>
Default: "" (false)

This variable works in conjunction with GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT. When it's true, the hidden timeout is completely silently, otherwise it shows the count down.
